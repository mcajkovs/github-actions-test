##  2. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction
Excalibur utilizes the mobile phone to act as a secure hardware token for any and all authentication and authorization needs inside of the enterprise. The ultimate goal is to move all forms of authentication and authorization away from passwords, replace them seamlessly with smartphone-based strong but user friendly multi-factor authentication. Excalibur's unique value is in providing backward compatibility with all the applications, Operating Systems (OS) and services the enterprise uses today thus creating a bridge between the password-based present day and password-free future.
Client - In the context of Excalibur, the client is usually a PC. The client component provides the Excalibur login screen that is displayed on top of the default Operating System login screen / lock screen. This is achieved utilizing the Excalibur Credential Provider
